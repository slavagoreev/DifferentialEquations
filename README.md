# DifferentialEquations
Differential Equations course project by Vyacheslav Goreev
It is available at: https://innoctf-checker.firebaseapp.com

### This is the short description of the sources:
The main technological stack is:
- Typescript for scripting
- SCSS for styles
- WebPack for bundling

The libraries used:
- Katex by Khan Academy for LaTeX rendering
- Chart.js for Graphs and Error representation

### Check out the code base
Recommended way is to start from 
- **src/js/models/method.model.ts** Is the object oriented model of all the methods used
- **src/js/graphs/euler/index.ts** Euler's method (all others are inherited from it)
- **src/js/views/index/index.ts** This is the main page source code
- **src/js/views/report/report.ts** This is report and solution of this equation

```I hope the project is interesting and I would like to present it in class```
